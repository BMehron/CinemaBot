# Cinema Bot
Telegram bot, which by the name of a movie or TV series, gives a list of movies and TV series with similar names.
You can click on any of these movies to get more detailed information about the movie, such as release date,
duration, short description, etc. The bot also provides links to sites (watch online button) where you can watch this movie.
The bot's language is Russian.
## API
1. As a library for working with the Telegram API, I used aiogram.
2. As a movie database, I use TMDB.

All network requests that the bot makes are executed asynchronously.
 
If it is not clear how to make requests to the bot, then the / help command will help you =)
